    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p> The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. 
		Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of childhood paralysis by a factor of ten thousand or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication.  
		However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. 
		To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection.  
		If poliovirus is somehow re-introduced after OPV cessation, will it be likely to cause outbreaks?  
		If the virus is from OPV, will the risk of vaccine-derived outbreaks always remain low? 
		To answer these questions, we built a multiscale mathematical model of infection and transmission with data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies.  
		The within-host model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and dose response.  
		The transmission model captures how shedding and dose response interact with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the force of infection in communities. 
		Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine alone is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low force of infection settings, and that OPV can be started and stopped safely in moderate force of infection settings. 
		However, in high force of infection settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. 
		With insufficient immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV.  
		We conclude that while eradication may still be achieved with continued use of Sabin OPV, a new vaccine is needed to secure eradication for all time.
